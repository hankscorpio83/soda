## Joysticks

The game supports DirectInput devices natively, but most modern controllers use XInput.

Possible solutions:
* Xbox 360/One controller
* PlayStation 3/4 controller
* Various 8BitDo controllers allow switching between modes on (Holding B and pressing Start to turn on wireless controllers, or holding B while plugging in wired controllers)
* [XInputPlus](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/2034-xinput-plus-v415064/) allows configuration of XInput devices, including the ability to output DirectInput

Be sure to Calibrate your controller in the Options menu and reassign the controls!
